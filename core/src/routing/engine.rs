//! Routing Decision Engine — Unified Layer Integration
//!
//! Combines all three routing layers (Local, Neighborhood, Global) to make optimal routing
//! decisions for every message. Implements mycorrhizal network principles: try direct paths
//! first, then nearby relays, then distant routes, and finally store-and-carry.
//!
//! Decision algorithm for every message:
//! 1. **Layer 1 (Mycelium)**: Check local cell for direct peer
//! 2. **Layer 2 (Rhizomorphs)**: Check neighborhood gateways if local misses
//! 3. **Layer 3 (CMN)**: Check global routes if neighborhood misses
//! 4. **Store-and-Carry**: No known route — hold until one appears or request discovery
