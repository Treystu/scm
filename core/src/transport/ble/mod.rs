/// BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Transport Module
///
/// This module provides the protocol-level abstractions for BLE-based messaging
/// in the SCMessenger sovereign mesh network. It includes:
///
/// - **beacon**: Encrypted beacon construction, parsing, and rotation for DarkBLE discovery
/// - **l2cap**: L2CAP channel abstraction with fragmentation and reassembly
/// - **gatt**: GATT service definitions with characteristic-based messaging
/// - **scanner**: BLE scanner with adaptive duty cycle management
///
/// The module is designed to work with platform-specific implementations (Swift/Kotlin)
/// that handle the actual BLE hardware operations. The core logic here is testable
/// without actual BLE hardware.
