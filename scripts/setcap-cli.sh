# Post-install: grant the scmessenger-cli binary CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE on
# Linux, so it can bind privileged ports (80/443) without running as root.
#
# Why this capability and not cap_net_raw/cap_net_admin: the CLI's BLE
# support (btleplug) talks to BlueZ entirely over the D-Bus system bus, not
# raw HCI sockets, so it needs no special Linux capabilities — BlueZ's own
# D-Bus policy governs non-root access. The actual root requirement in this
# codebase is core/src/transport/multiport.rs's privileged-port listen
# addresses (used when running as a public bootstrap/relay node offering a
# cellular-friendly WebSocket fallback on :443, matching the
# CORE_BOOTSTRAP_NODES addresses in transport/bootstrap.rs) — binding those
# ports below 1024 requires CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE without root.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/setcap-cli.sh [path-to-scmessenger-cli]
#
# Defaults to target/release/scmessenger-cli relative to the repo root.
