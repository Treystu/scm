# SCMessenger Android

Android client app for SCMessenger using Kotlin/Compose with UniFFI integration to Rust core.

Primary product target is unified Android+iOS+Web parity delivery.

## Build Prerequisites

- Rust toolchain
- `cargo-ndk`
- Android Rust targets:
  - `aarch64-linux-android`
  - `armv7-linux-androideabi`
  - `x86_64-linux-android`
  - `i686-linux-android`
- Java 17+
- Android SDK with `ANDROID_HOME` set

## Verify Environment

```bash
cd android
./verify-build-setup.sh
```

Latest local verification summary (2026-02-23):

- Rust/cargo/cargo-ndk: present
- Android Rust targets: present
- UniFFI Kotlin binding generation: pass
- Build preflight passes when `ANDROID_HOME=/Users/christymaxwell/Library/Android/sdk`
- `./gradlew assembleDebug`: pass

## Build

```bash
cd android
ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk" ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Fresh Device Install (Recommended)

```bash
./android/install-clean.sh
```

This runs `clean + :app:installDebug` and can uninstall the previous package first so physical-device testing always uses the newest APK.
It also grants required runtime permissions (`Bluetooth`, `Location`, `Nearby WiFi`, `Notifications`) after install so discovery transports come up immediately.

## Runtime Architecture

- Rust core (`scmessenger-core`) provides identity, crypto, transport, and storage.
- UniFFI bridge (`scmessenger-mobile`) exposes `MeshService`, `SwarmBridge`, and managers.
- Android app layers:
  - `MeshRepository` as integration boundary
  - Compose UI + ViewModels
  - BLE/WiFi transport managers
  - foreground service and platform callbacks

## Canonical Semantics

- Canonical identity for cross-platform exchange/persistence: `public_key_hex`.
- `identity_id` and `libp2p_peer_id` are derived/operational identifiers.
- Relay controls remain user-toggleable; OFF must block inbound/outbound relay messaging while preserving local history reads.

## Security Notes

- Identity/signing: Ed25519
- Message encryption path: X25519 ECDH + XChaCha20-Poly1305 (implemented in Rust core)
- No central account requirement in core protocol model

## Known Open Gaps

- WiFi Aware transport needs device-level validation across supported hardware:
  - `android/app/src/main/java/com/scmessenger/android/transport/WifiAwareTransport.kt`
- Bootstrap strategy currently includes static defaults; target direction is startup env config + dynamic fetch with static fallback.
- Privacy toggle parity with iOS requires full parity-first wiring of all controls.
