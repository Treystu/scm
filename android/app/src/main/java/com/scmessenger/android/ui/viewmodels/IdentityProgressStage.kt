/**
 * High-level proof-of-work stages emitted by both [MainViewModel.createIdentity]
 * and [IdentityViewModel.createIdentity].
 *
 * The same 6 stages are emitted on both the onboarding path and the in-settings
 * path so the user sees a single, deterministic progress narrative regardless of
 * which entry point they used.
 *
 * Each stage carries:
 *   - id:        stable ordinal (1..6) used to drive "step X of 6" + checkmarks
 *   - label:     short, user-facing label (1-4 words, no jargon)
 *   - detail:    one short sentence telling the user what's happening
 *                (technical but not too deep — "Setting up secure storage"
 *                beats "GRANT_CONSENT via sled-backed persistence")
 *   - etaMs:     typical wall-clock duration in milliseconds for this stage
 *                on a mid-range Android device (Pixel 6a baseline). The UI
 *                uses this to render a stage progress bar and to drive a
 *                "About 6 seconds remaining" hint. The actual duration is
 *                not a contract — it is a best-effort estimate so the user
 *                sees motion, not a precision claim.
