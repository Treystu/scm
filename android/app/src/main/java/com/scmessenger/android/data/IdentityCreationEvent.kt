/**
 * Type-agnostic progress events emitted by [MeshRepository.createIdentity] as it
 * works through the six sub-stages of identity creation. The data layer has no
 * UI dependencies, so we keep this enum here rather than reaching into
 * `ui.viewmodels.IdentityProgressStage`. The ViewModel maps each
 * [IdentityCreationEvent] to the corresponding [IdentityProgressStage] so the
 * existing [IdentityProgressDisplay] composable continues to render the same
 * six-stage narrative without any change to its parameter shape.
 *
 * The shape of this enum mirrors [IdentityProgressStage] intentionally — the
 * repo's behavior and the UI's presentation are deliberately aligned, so
 * duplicating the six names is preferable to introducing a new abstraction.
 *
 * The second callback slot is a transient sub-stage detail string the UI can
 * render under the active stage's `detail` line; the repo uses it to show
 * motion during otherwise-blocking work (e.g. SharedPreferences `commit()`,
 * libp2p TCP bind). Pass `null` when no transient detail is available.
