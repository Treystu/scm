 * operation must not be initiated until the callback for the first one fires.
 * All GATT reads and writes are funnelled through a per-device
 * [Channel]<[() -> Unit]> + [Semaphore](1) queue. The consumer coroutine
 * acquires the semaphore before launching each op, and the GATT callback
 * releases it once the result arrives, allowing the next op to proceed.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Connects to discovered SCMessenger BLE peripherals
 * - Reads identity beacon to get peer's public key
 * - Initiates sync handshake for Drift protocol
 * - Writes encrypted message frames
 * - Manages connection lifecycle and retry logic
 * - Handles reliable write with chunking for >MTU payloads
 * - Maintains connection pool (max 5 concurrent)
