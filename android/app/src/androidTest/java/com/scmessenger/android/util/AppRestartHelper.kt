/**
 * Helper utility for force-stopping and restarting the test app.
 *
 * This utility provides a reliable way to simulate app restart behavior
 * during UI tests, which is necessary to verify data persistence across
 * app launches.
 *
 * ## Implementation Notes
 *
 * The force-stop approach uses `am force-stop` shell command which:
 * 1. Completely stops all processes for the target package
 * 2. Clears all runtime state (RAM, background services, etc.)
 * 3. Simulates a true cold-start scenario on relaunch
 *
 * This is more reliable than in-process activity recreation which doesn't
 * actually persist data the same way a real app restart does.
 *
 * ## Requirements
 *
 * - API 23+ (Marshmallow) for `executeShellCommand` permissions
 * - Instrumentation test context (AndroidJUnitRunner)
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * AppRestartHelper.forceStopAndRestart(packageName)
 * ```

     * @param packageName The package name to restart (typically from context.packageName)

     * ## Thread Safety
     *
     * This method should be called from a background thread. The instrumentation
     * UI automation is thread-safe but the shell commands involve I/O.
